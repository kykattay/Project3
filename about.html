        <p class="header">ABOUT</p>

        <p class="about">Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989 in Reading, Pennsylvania. By the age of 10, Taylor was singing at a variety of local events, including fairs and contests. She began writing her own songs and learning guitar at 12 years old.</p>

        <p class="about">After moving to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue her music career, a stellar performance at The Bluebird Café in Nashville helped Taylor a contract with Scott Borchetta's Big Machine Records. She released her first single, "Tim McGraw," in 2006, and the song became a Top 10 hit on the country charts. It also appeared on her self-titled debut album...which went on to sell more than 5 million copies. For her debut album she won the Horizon Award from the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Award for Top New Female Vocalist in 2007.</p>
        
        <p class="about">In 2008, Taylor released her next album, “Fearless,” which hit the top of both the country and pop charts and stayed there for 11 weeks. By the end of the year, Taylor had become the highest-selling country artist of 2008. In 2009 Swift won the MTV Video Music Award's Best Female Video, for "You Belong With Me," making her the first country music star to earn a VMA.</p>
        
        <p class="about">In 2010 she became the youngest artist to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, for Fearless. That year Taylor released a new album, “Speak Now,” which was a success, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. She followed with “Red” (2012), which also topped 1 million in its first week of sales.</p>
        
        <p class="about">With the release of her next album, “1989,” Taylor stepped away from country and into pop. Her singles were chart-topping and this 2014 release moved more than 1.2 million copies in its first week, making Taylor the first artist to top the 1 million mark in opening-week sales for three albums. In February 2016, at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards Taylor won another Grammy for Album of the Year, making music history as the first woman to win the award twice.</p> 
        
        <p class="about">After taking some time away from the spotlight, Taylor released her sixth studio album, “reputation,” on November 10, 2017. “reputation” sold 1.05 million copies in the United States over its first four days. Along with giving Taylor her fourth consecutive album to surpass 1 million in sales for its opening week, this was the top-selling album of 2017. In 2019 Taylor released “Lover” and it was the top-selling album of 2019. It was the highest selling album since “reputation” and broke the record for most simultaneous entries by a female artist in Billboard's Hot 100 history with all 18 tracks from “Lover” charting.</p>
        
        <p class="about">In December 2019, Swift was featured a live-action adaptation of the famed Broadway musical Cats, and wrote an original song, “Beautiful Ghosts,” for the film. Her documentary, “Miss Americana,” was released in January of 2020.</p>
        
        <p class="about">After months in quarantine during the Covid-19 global pandemic, Taylor announced on July 23, 2020, on Instagram that she would be releasing her eighth studio album “folklore.” Less than five months later she did the same thing. On December 10, 2020, Taylor once again announced that she was going to drop a surprise album titled “evermore.” At the 2021 Grammy Awards 'folklore' went on to win Album of the Year, making history becoming the only female solo artist to win that award three times.</p>
        
        <p class="about">In June 2019, Swift revealed her dismay that her catalog of music from her first six albums, up to “reputation,” had been sold by her first label and she was not given the chance to purchase them. She announced that she would go back and re-record the records that had been sold to regain ownership of her catalog. Her first re-release was of her 2008 album, “Fearless,” in April of 2021 with her re-release of 2012’s “Red” in November of 2021. These re-recorded albums feature songs “From The Vault,” which are songs that didn’t make the cut for the original album. In the coming years, Taylor will release the re-recordings of her other four albums that were sold.</p> 
        
        <p class="about">She has won 11 Grammy Awards, 32 American Music Awards, 10 CMA Awards, 2 ARIA Awards, 25 Billboard Music Awards, 2 Brit Awards, 13 iHeart Radio Music Awards, 13 People’s Choice Awards, among countless others.</p>
